# Cinema Tracker #

## Overview ##

This project will scrape Gmail emails for booking confirmations for any (UK) Odeon cinema, it will then post the details of this to your Google Calendar, along with your booking reference so you have it ready to collect your tickets.

In the future it might also log what you watch and how often, and suggest new filmes you might want to see based on what you've seen in the past.
